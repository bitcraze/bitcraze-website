Crazyradio PA is a long range open USB radio dongle based on the
nRF24LU1+ from Nordic Semiconductor. It features a 20dBm power
amplifier, LNA and comes pre-programmed with Crazyflie compatible
firmware. The power amplifier boosts the range, giving a range of up to
1km (line of sight) together with the Crazyflie 2.X and up to 2km
Crazyradio PA to Crazyradio PA (line of sight).

{% product_highlight

Open project;
The Crazyradio PA is not only for the Crazyflie 2.X.
%}

Since it's an open project with firmware written from scratch and
a Python API to control it, it's a great building block for systems
that require longer range than WiFi and doesn't have the same
requirements for bandwidth. The hardware comes shipped with the latest
firmware as well as a bootloader that enables firmware upgrades via USB
without any additional hardware needed. The Crazyflie PA is compatible
with the first generation of the Crazyflie, but will not give the same
range increase as with the Crazyflie 2.X.
