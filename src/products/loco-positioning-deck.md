Let your Crazyflie 2.X know where it is using the Loco Positioning expansion deck

The Loco Positioning Deck is a Tag in a Loco Positioning system and measures
the distances to Anchors. The distances are used to estimate the
absolute position of the Crazyflie 2.X in the room, which can be used for
autonomous flight. The position is calculated on-board of the Crazyflie and there
is no need for an external computer for position estimation.
