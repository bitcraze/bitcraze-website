# External projects

There are a few external projects that are based on Bitcraze hardware and/or software.
We usually do not provide support for these projects but we have collected a few
links to help any one that is interested.

### Disclamer
These projects may or may not be actively maintained. We do not take any
responsibility for the functionality or compatibility in any way.

## Swarming

Projects aiming at supporting swarms. They might also be useful for controlling single Crazyflies.

| ![ROS](/images/icons/ros2_tm.png)  | The IMRClab at TU Berlin has implemented a ROS 2 package to handle large swarms of Crazyflies. This is the successor of Crazyswarm(1) | <https://imrclab.github.io/crazyswarm2/> |
| ![ROS](/images/icons/ros_64.png)  | The ACT lab at USC has implemented a ROS 1 library to handle large swarms of Crazyflies. | <https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> |
| ![ROS](/images/icons/ros_64.png) |A Crazyflie control packages (deprecated, use Crazyswarm instead)| <https://github.com/whoenig/crazyflie_ros> |
| Crazyserver | A server exposing a REST API to control a swarm of Crazyflies. Written in Go. | <https://github.com/mikehamer/crazyserver> |
| LaMoucheFolle | Cross-platform OSC server for controlling multiple Crazyflies 2.x | <https://github.com/benkuper/LaMoucheFolle> |

## Connectivity libraries

Libraries for connecting to the Crazyflie written in various languages. They are
usually implementing functionality similar to the Bitcraze python library.
