There is a big interest from the community to get hold of the prototypes we are
working on and to try out the latest and greatest designs. Since we very much
recognize that urge and sympathise with those feelings, we want to make new stuff
available to the community as soon as possible. We call this the "Early access"
program.

“Early access” means that the hardware design is finalized and available in the online shop
and from distributors, but the software is still in a rudimentary state. There
are probably drivers to communicate with the hardware, but no higher level
functionality is implemented yet.

You can read more about how "Early access" fits in the bigger picture on the
[product cycle](/about/product-cycle/) page.

## Collaborate

The benefits are mutual, we make it possible for our users to get started with
new hardware and development at an earlier stage in the development cycle, in
return we hope the community will help out with important feedback and
contributions towards finalizing the product.

This approach corresponds greatly to our view on how we want to work and
develop our products. We see this as a further way to extend our efforts in
collaborating with others in the spirit of open source and sharing knowledge.

## Contribute

We run each "early access" project as an open project on Github with a
a repository named "early-access-XXX" as the focal point. Since many changes
in the Bitcraze software stack spans over multiple repositories (firmware,
clients, radio and so on), this "early-access" repo is where to post issues or
feature requests, discuss solutions and what to implement. We love to
collaborate with the community, join the fun!

The goal is to break down the work into issues that are well defined and
reasonably sized, to make it easy for everyone to join. Grab an issue and
get your hands dirty! If you need help, ask for it in the focus repo.

## Communication

We use the blog to communicate new "Early access" projects and we mark
products on the product pages with an "Early access" logo.

## Should I buy an "Early access" product?

If you are eager to get your hands on the latest hardware and are prepared to
dive into the code to make stuff work - then you should.

If you prefer a more finalized product that you can simply plug in and use, or
feel that you need documentation and example code, then you should probably not
buy it - yet.
