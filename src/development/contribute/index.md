## Contributing in github

The source code for firmware, clients, tools and the web site are hosted on github.
We use pull requests for code contributions, read more about how it works on
[github](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

There is a contribute.md file in each project that describes the requirements in that
specific project when it comes to coding style, unit testing and so on.
