{% si_intro The STEM ranging bundle %}
The STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) ranging bundle is based on a Crazyflie 2.x with a {% poplink flow-deck %} and a {% poplink multi-ranger-deck%}.
It is an autonomous drone that can be controlled from a simple python script to explore and operate a robot in 3 dimensions.
It has the ability to detect obstacles around it.

This getting started guide will help you set up the system and make your first autonomous interactive flight.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step required hardware %}
* 1 x Crazyflie 2.x kit
* 1 x {% poplink crazyradio-2-0 %} or Crazyradio PA
* 1 x {% poplink flow-deck %}
* 1 x {% poplink multi-ranger-deck%}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step prerequisites %}
This getting started guide assumes you have already assembled your Crazyflie 2.x. If that is not the case please follow the {% id_link getting-started-crazyflie-2 %}

This guide also requires that you have updated the Crazyflie to the latest firmware. For more information on how to update the firmware, see the [update firmware in the Crazyflie]({% id_url getting-started-crazyflie-2; update-fw %}) section in our getting started with Crazyflie 2.x tutorial.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step  mounting the Flow V2 deck %}
Mount the {% poplink flow-deck %} underneath and the {% poplink multi-ranger-deck%} above the Crazyflie 2.x using the long pin-headers supplied with the Crazyflie 2.x kit.

For more information about how to mount an expansion deck please see the {% id_link getting-started-expansion-decks %} tutorial.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step installing Python and the cflib%}
{% tabgroup %}
{% tab Windows %}
The backend library used to control the Crazyflie 2.x is called cflib and is written
in python 3. To use it you must have Pyhton 3 installed on the computer and it can
be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org).

Install python using the standard settings, and for convenience tick the Add to PATH checkbox.
{% img Python install; wide; /images/tutorials/getting_started_stem/python3_toPATH.png %}

When python 3 is installed, open a command prompt and install the cflib using pip.

Type ```pip3 install cflib``` in the command prompt

{% img cflib install; wide; /images/tutorials/getting_started_stem/pip_cflib.png %}
{% endtab %}
{% tab Ubuntu %}
The following instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.

To install Python, pip and the Crazyflie library run the following commands:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-usb idle3
pip3 install cflib
```

Your user needs access to USB devices in order to use the Crazyradio, run the
following lines to grant access. After the command is run the Crazyradio needs
to be inserted again for the rules to take effect.

``` bash
sudo groupadd plugdev
sudo usermod -a -G plugdev $USER
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1915", ATTRS{idProduct}=="7777", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-crazyradio.rules
```

{% endtab %}
{% endtabgroup %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step  running your first flight script %}
Now when everything is setup and installed start the Python editor IDLE3.
Select *File->New* and copy/past the script below into the new script. Save
the script with a suitable name.

``` python
"""
Example script that allows a user to "push" the Crazyflie 2.x around
using your hands while it's hovering.

This examples uses the Flow and Multi-ranger decks to measure distances
in all directions and tries to keep away from anything that comes closer
than 0.2m by setting a velocity in the opposite direction.

The demo is ended by either pressing Ctrl-C or by holding your hand above the
Crazyflie.

            print('Demo terminated!')
```

Run the script by pressing F5.

**Note**: If you have the python client open, make sure the Crazyflie is disconnected from it.
The Crazyradio does not support connections from multiple programs simultaneously and
the script will not work if the Crazyflie still is connected to the python client.

The output should look similar to this.

```
Connecting to radio://0/110/2M
Connected to radio://0/110/2M
Demo terminated!
```

{% si_step what's next? %}
* Explore the different [example scripts](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python/blob/master/examples).
* Explore the [motion commander](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python/blob/master/cflib/positioning/motion_commander.py) class. The class can do more then simple directional commands such as scripting using speed and time or together with events.
* Try out the logging and parameter framework. The [basic logging](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python/blob/master/examples/basiclogSync.py) is a good example to start from or digg into the details on the [documentation](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/userguides/logparam/).
* Connect a gamepad and with the {% poplink flow-deck %} to try optical flow stabilized flight.
