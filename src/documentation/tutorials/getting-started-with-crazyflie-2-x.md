{% si_intro Unpacking the Crazyflie %}
The Crazyflie box contains the following items. Make sure that you
have all of them before you start assembling.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step package contents %}
* 1 x Crazyflie 2.0 or 2.1 control board with all components mounted
* 5 x CW propellers
* 5 x CCW propellers
* 6 x Motor mounts
* 1 x LiPo battery
* 5 x Coreless DC motors
* 2 x Short expansion connector pins (1×10, 2mm spacing, 8 or 9 mm long)
* 2 x Long expansion connector pins (1×10, 2mm spacing, 14 or 15 mm long)
* 1 x Battery holder expansion board
* 1 x USB cable (only with the Crazyflie 2.1)
{% endsi_step %}



{% si_intro Testing; test %}
The Crazyflie is tested extensively when produced, but to make sure
nothing has happened during shipping/storage you should run the tests before
starting the assembly. Power on the Crazyflie using a USB source (either
computer or charger) and check the results of the test below. Note that it’s
important to hold the Crazyflie steady during the test and away from strong
magnetic sources.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step self-test %}
Before you start assembling anything, run the power on self-test by
connecting the Crazyflie to a uUSB power source. The LEDs M1 and M4
will indicate the result of the test. If the M4 LED blinks GREEN five times
fast, then the test has passed.

{% tutorialVideo /videos/self_test_pass.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step self-test fails %}
If the self-test fails, then the M1 LED blinks 5 times fast RED, then pauses
and does it again. Go to our [support discussions](https://discussions.bitcraze.io) to get help.

{% tutorialVideo /videos/self_test_fails.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}



{% si_intro Assembling; assembling %}
Assembling your Crazyflie will probably take less than 10 minutes, but
there are a few pitfalls. So make sure to follow the instructions below!
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step twisting the wires %}
Start by twisting the wires of the four motors. This will reduce electronic
noise and make the wires fit better in the motor mount “hooks”.

{% tutorialVideo /videos/twisting_the_wires.mp4 %}

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step mount the motors %}
Push the four motors into the motor mounts. You will need some force to
insert them. If it is difficult doing it as in the video try putting the
motor can towards a table edge and press on the mount, however don’t press
on the motor axis while inserting them as it might damage the motor. The
motor should be inserted all the way to the stop in the mount.

{% tutorialVideo /videos/mount_the_motors.mp4 %}

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach the twisted wire %}
Attach the twisted wire into the two small “hooks” that are underneath the
motor mount.

{% tutorialVideo /videos/attach_the_twisted wire.mp4 %}

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step insert the motor %}
Insert the motor mounts on the Crazyflie wings. They are press fit and
might need a small amount of force. Make sure they go all the way to the
stop. It’s not important which motor you put where. After it’s been
inserted, connect the motor connectors to the Crazyflie.
{% tutorialVideo /videos/insert_the_motor.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach the propellers %}
Now it’s time to attach the propellers.

Note: There are two kinds of
propellers, the clock wise (CW) and counter clock wise (CCW) propellers,
each kind has their own bag in the box. Notice the shape of the tips, the
sharper corner is on back side of the rotation direction. The CW propellers
are also usually marked with an "A", "A1" or "A2", while the CCW propellers
are marked with "B", "B1" or "B2" (the number is irrelevant). For the Crazyflie 2.1+ 
the propellers will look a bit different and the CW propellers are marked "47-17R" 
while CCW "47-17".

Also make sure that the correct side is facing up, the top side should be convex.

Here we are attaching the CW propellers for the Crazyflie 2.1 (not 2.1+ version).



{% tutorialVideo /videos/attach_the_propellers.mp4 %}

Here’s a detailed view of where to attach CW and CCW propellers.
{% img Crazyflie propeller mounting; medium; /images/getting-started/cf2_props.png %}

{% endsi_step %}


{% si_step attach the rubber pad %}
The rubber pad should be attached to the Crazyflie between the
expansion headers. This will create friction, keep the battery from
slipping out and also protect the electronics.
{% tutorialVideo /videos/attach_the_rubber_pad.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach headers %}
There are two types of headers in the box, long and short ones. Find the
two short ones and insert them into the expansion connector.
{% tutorialVideo /videos/attach_headers.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step attach the battery %}
Place the battery between the headers inserted into the expansion connector
and insert the battery holder board onto the headers. Watch out for the
pins that can be a bit sharp when inserting it. The friction should hold
the battery in place so tighten it until it does.

Now connect the battery
and you are finished with the assembly. The battery wires can preferably be
bent and placed underneath the PCB to be out of the way.
{% tutorialVideo /videos/attach_the_battery.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step power on! %}
The assembly is finished, now it’s time to power it on! Note that the power
button is a push button, not a sliding button. During the power-on
self-test all the propellers will spin in sequence. Make sure they all
spin, if they don’t then check the motor connections.
{% tutorialVideo /videos/power_on.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step getting to know your Crazyflie; leds %}
First of all, lets look at what is front and back, this is important when flying
and also when mounting expansion decks. The small "bump" (the antenna) is on the front
and the blue LEDs are at the back.
{% img Crazyflie board from the top; medium; /images/getting-started/frontCF.png %}

#### Start up sequence

When the Crazyflie is powered on it will automatically go through a short
sequence of events to get ready for flight.

1. **Run self tests** - the Crazyflie checks that the hardware is OK
1. **Calibrate sensors** - the Crazyflie reads its sensors to get base values.
It must be *absolutely still* to do this, so it's best to put it on a level surface for a second.
1. **Ready to fly!**

#### Understanding LEDs

You also need to understand what the LEDs mean.

* **Power on and all is good:** The blue LEDs (2 and 3) are fully lit and the
front right LED (1) is blinking red twice every second (see the video in the [Power on!](#power-on-) section above.).
* **Power on and all is good but sensors are not yet calibrated:** The blue LEDs
(2 and 3) are fully lit and the front right LED (1) is blinking red with 2 seconds interval.
Put the Crazyflie on a level surface and keep it absolutely still to calibrate.
* **Radio connected:** The front left LED (4) is flickering in red and/or green.
* **Battery low:** The front right LED (1) is fully lit in red. It's time to
land and re-charge the battery.
* **Charging:** The back left blue LED (3) is blinking while the right back blue LED (2) is lit.
* **Boot loader mode:** The blue LEDs (2 and 3) at the back are blinking
approximately once every second.
* **Self test fail:** The right front LED (1) is repeatedly blinking five short
red pulses with a longer pause between groups.
{% endsi_step %}



{% si_intro Controlling the Crazyflie %}
You can fly the Crazyflie either from a mobile device or a computer.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step choose controller device %}
{% tabgroup %}

Continue reading the next section for instructions on how to install the app on your phone
{% tab Computer %}
Using your computer requires a {% poplink crazyradio-2-0 %} or Crazyradio PA but will give you more options
and greater control. If you want to fly the Crazyflie manually you can use a gamepad of your choice connected to your computer alongside the Crazyradio.

Continue reading the [installing on a computer](#inst-comp) section if you
want to use your computer.
{% endtab %}

{% tab Mobile device %}
Using a mobile device is the fastest way to get into the air, but it is designed mostly for testing purposes.
If you want to get the most out of your Crazyflie, flying using a PC and Crazyradio is what we recommend.

It is really easy to install the app and connect to the Crazyflie and get it flying. It might demand some extra piloting skills though.
All you need is an Android or iOS device that supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).


{% si_step install the app %}
The Crazyflie client is available for Android and iOS.

[For Android, from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.bitcraze.crazyfliecontrol2)

[For iPhone, from Apple iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crazyflie-2.0/id946151480?mt=8)

{% img Crazyflie app; narrow; /images/getting-started/cf-mobile-app.png %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step connect to the Crazyflie %}
Start the app and click the connect button. The buttons have different
appearances in the Android and iOS apps, you can see them below.

**Note**: If you are using Android and your Crazyflie is behaving strange (like dropping from the air or is reacting slowly),
turn on the "Bluetooth latency workaround" setting.

{% endsi_step %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabgroup %}
{% endsi_step %}



{% si_intro Installing on a computer; inst-comp %}
When using a computer to fly the Crazyflie, you also need a standard
gamepad ([more information](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-clients-python/master/userguides/inputdevices/))
for maneuvering and a {% poplink crazyradio-2-0 %} or Crazyradio PA for communication.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step installation flavour %}
There are a few options of how to run the PC client

{% tabgroup %}
{% tab Native install (recommended) %}
The supported way to install and run the client on a computer currently is to install
the Crazyflie client using the python package manager *pip*.

You can follow the prerequisite and instructions to install the latest release on the
[Client installation instruction page](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-clients-python/master/installation/install/).


When you have set up the client, insert the {% poplink crazyradio-2-0 %} or Crazyradio PA and your gamepad in
your USB-ports and start the client. Continue reading about how to [configure the client](#config-client)
{% endtab %}
{% tab Virtual Machine %}
We have set up a virtual machine (VM) designed to assist you in getting started with flight and development. The VM includes essential software for your needs, all pre-installed to simplify the setup process.

Running on a virtual machine allows for compatibility across various operating systems. However, please be aware that the VM may not have been regularly maintained, and there could be some issues present.

**Note**: Since the VM is an AMD64 install of Linux, it *does not work* on Apple-silicon Mac (M1/2/... processors).
On an apple silicon mac you need to install the tools natively.


{% si_step Installing on Virtual Machine; inst-vm %}
To help you get into the air as quickly as possible, the virtual machine (VM)
has all the software you need for flight and development already installed.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step Setup virtual Machine; inst-virtualbox %}

{% endsi_step %}

{% endtab %}
{% endtabgroup %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_intro Configure the client; config-client %}
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step configure your controller; config-controller %}
In the client, open the input device settings. Check if the correct device
mapping is chosen, otherwise pick your device type.
{% img Controller settings; wide; /images/getting-started/configure_your_controller.PNG %}

For more detailed information on input devices, see the [client user-guide](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-clients-python/master/userguides/inputdevices/).

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step update firmware in the Crazyflie; update-fw %}
To make sure that your Crazyflie has all the latest features you should always update the firmware to the newest version. To find out how you can check out the client user-guide [here](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-clients-python/master/userguides/userguide_client/#firmware-upgrade).

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step connect to the Crazyflie; connect-pc-client %}
* In the Crazyflie client choose the correct __Address__. The default one is 0xE7E7E7E7E7. To figure out or change the __Address__ of your Crazyflie, you can follow the [radio address configuration](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-clients-python/master/userguides/userguide_client/#radio-address-configuration) guide.
* Then click the __Scan__ button in top left corner. The radio settings for your Crazyflie is displayed in the drop-down list.
* Choose your Crazyflie from the drop-down list.

{% img Connect dialog; wide; /images/getting-started/connect_to_the_crazyflie.PNG %}
* Click the __Connect__ button.

Now that you have connected your Crazyflie to your client, telemetry data
is continuously sent from the copter to the client. When you move the
Crazyflie around you will see the flight data being updated in realtime, as
well as battery status and the link quality.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_intro Flying; flying %}
Now it's time to do some flying, but first there are some basics you need to know about.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step orientation; orientation %}
First of all, it is much easier to fly when the copter is pointing away from you.
The blue LEDs are on the back, so keep them pointing in your direction when
starting to fly.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step maneuvering a quadcopter; maneuvering %}
When flying a quadcopter there are four main dimensions of controls; roll, pitch, yaw and thrust.
{% img Axis; wide; /images/getting-started/AxisImage.png %}

* **Roll -** is the rotation around a horizontal axis going through the quadcopter
from back to front. This literally rolls the Crazyflie and moves it left or right.
* **Pitch -** is the rotation around a horizontal axis going through the quadcopter
from left to right. This tilts the Crazyflie and moves it forwards or backwards.
* **Yaw -** is the rotation around a vertical axis. This rotates the quadcopter
left or right. Yaw is used when changing flying direction by pointing the front
of the Crazyflie in different directions.
* **Thrust -** adjusts the altitude, or height, of the Crazyflie.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step the mobile app / game controller %}
The controls on the gamepad or mobile app have the following mapping:
{% img Control mapping; medium; /images/getting-started/controller.png %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step normal flight %}
When thrusting without touching any other controls, this is what it might
look like. The Crazyflie usually drifts in some direction if not
compensated for, this is completely normal.
{% tutorialVideo /videos/normal_flight.mp4 %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step the ground effect; ground-effect %}
When the copter is flying close to the ground (less than a few decimeters
above the ground) it is effected by what is called the ground effect. The
feeling is that the air is slippery, almost as if it is gliding on ice.
To avoid this, particularly when learning to fly, use a lot of thrust just
when taking off and then ease off for level flight.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step if the Crazyflie is unbalanced; unbalanced %}
If your Crazyflie drifts a lot when taking off, there are a few things you should check.

* Make sure the battery is centered. If it has slipped
too far to either side, the Crazyflie might have a hard time
compensating for it.
* Check that the propellers are spinning freely. Blow lightly on them, one by one,
and verify that they turn. A common problem is that hair is jammed between the
propeller and motor. If this is the problem. just pull the propeller off from the
motor, remove the hair and reinstall the propeller.
* Check that the propellers are balanced, {% id_link balancing-propellers %}
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step charging the battery; charging %}
To charge the battery of the Crazyflie, just plug in a micro USB cable. Make
sure the Crazyflie is powered on. While the battery is charging, the back left
blue LED will blink. When the LED is fully lit the battery is charged.
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step go fly! %}
Have fun!
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_intro Support %}
If anything is wrong with the Crazyflie after following this guide, make sure to checkout the {% id_link support-getting-help %} page.
{% endsi_intro %}
