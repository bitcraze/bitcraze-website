    charging
4.  **LED 4**: Red/green LED used to indicate radio communication
5.  **Right expansion connector**: The expansion port is used to
    connect expansion boards, either on the top and/or the bottom
6.  **Left expansion connector**: The expansion port is used to
    connect expansion boards, either on the top and/or the bottom
7.  **Expansion board orientation indicator**: This indicator
    should match the expansion boards
