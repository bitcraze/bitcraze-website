## Crazyflie 2.x firmware

Reflash the crazyflie's firmware with [the cfclient firmware instructions](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-clients-python/master/userguides/userguide_client/#firmware-upgrade) with a {% poplink crazyradio-2-0 %} or a {% id_link product-crazyradio-pa %}.

Latest stable release of the binary files can be found
[in the github releases page](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-release/releases "GitHub releases for crazyflie-firmware").

## Bitcraze Virtual Machine

See the VM download section on [github](https://github.com/bitcraze/bitcraze-vm/releases/)
for the latest version. You will also find older versions there if you need them.

Please consult the [getting started tutorial for installation instructions for the VM](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-crazyflie-2-x/#inst-comp)

**Note**: Since the VM is an AMD64 install of Linux, it *does not work* on Apple-silicon Mac (M1/2/... processors).
On an apple silicon mac you need to install the tools natively.

## Crazyflie ROS 2 client CrazySwarm

This is an external project. Please consult [the Crazyswarm2 website](https://imrclab.github.io/crazyswarm2/) for download and installation instructions.
