## It's open

The Crazyflie eco system is an open development platform consisting of open 
hardware and open source firmware/software. The reason for making it open is 
that we want users to be able to hack, modify, experiment and learn from our 
platform. The projects are developed using only open tools. Since our projects 
are open we want users to have access to the tools needed for viewing, 
editing and using them.
