### Virtual Machine:
For this workshop we have made a [Bitcraze VM with AIdeck development environment](https://files.bitcraze.io/public/vm/BitcrazeVM_aideck.ova) (10Gb). This VM has already preconfigured docker images for flashing both the GAP8 and the NINA chip. All you need to do is to cd to your examples (like 'cd projects/aideck-gap8-examples/GAP8/test_functionalities/test_camera') and type the following command:
- If you want to try out the code on RAM only: 	'gap_run'
- If you want to flash the gap8:               	'gap_flash'

To reflash the NINA, go to 'aideck-gap8-examples/NINA/firmware' and type:
- To configure and flash the Nina: 		'nina_flash'

These commands are configured ~/.bashrc. Also check if the configured programmer file in the same script matches yours!

**Note**: Since the VM is an AMD64 install of Linux, it *does not work* on Apple-silicon Mac (M1/2/... processors).
On an apple silicon mac you need to install the tools natively.
