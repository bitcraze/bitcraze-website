We will be going to ICRA 2024, Yokohama Japan on the May 13th - June 17th! We will be located at booth **IC085**.


## Decentralized Swarm Demo

What we will show  shown at our booth was a fully decentralized swarm demo where we showed of several items:

- **The [lighthouse positioning system]({% id_url lighthouse-system-overview %}) for onboard positioning**: We have showed these a couple of times but now we were able to fly with the latest improvements (see [this blogpost](/2022/03/multiple-base-stations-with-lighthouse/)).
- **Peer to peer communication**: The crazyflies were communicating with eachother with the [peer to peer](/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/functional-areas/p2p_api/) functionality. This was used to indicate eachothers state and position. Here they arrange together who will take off and who will not.
- **Inter drone avoidance**: The p2p position sharing was used for in air obstacle avoidance with eachother. This is using the collision avoidance module written by James Preiss of University of Southern California (see this [PR](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/pull/628)).

The ground work for this awesome demo was done by our 2022 summer intern Marios Stamatopoulos who has written more details in his [blogpost](/2022/08/our-intern-marios-summer-work-on-swarms/). We have improved this demo further after our attendance at IROS 2022, which can read in [this blogpost](/2022/11/the-iros-2022-demo/)

### Products used in the demo

The following products are used in the demo, are available for purchase in
[our store](https://store.bitcraze.io/).

#### The Crazyflie 2.1

The {% id_link product-crazyflie-2-1 %}
is a small, flexible quadrotor, suitable for research and education. The small
size and light weight makes it safe and robust if crashing, while the open source
software opens up the possibility to modify or examine any part of the functionality.

#### The Lighthouse positioning system

The {% id_link lighthouse-system-overview %}
is based on the Valve Lighthouse base stations,
used in the SteamVR gaming kit. It has very high precision and
accuracy to an affordable price, making it possible to use in any office or
class room. The position is estimated in the Crazyflie quadrotor which makes the system
robust and easy to use.

#### The Qi 1.2 wireless charging deck

The {% poplink qi-1-2-wireless-charging-deck %}
uses the same standard as mobile phones which
makes it easy to find a compatible charger.

#### The Crazyradio PA

The {% id_link product-crazyradio-pa %}
is a USB dongle radio that is used to communicate with the Crazyflie.
It supports up to 800 packets/s to multiple Crazyflies simultaneously.

#### The charging pad

The charging pads are based on the wireless charger "NORDMÄRKE" from [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/)
with a 3D-printed pad. The FreeCad and stl files for the pad are available on GitHub in
[Landing_pad_rallen_v5.fcstd](https://github.com/bitcraze/bitcraze-mechanics/blob/master/models/Landing_pad_rallen_v5.fcstd) and
[Landing_pad_v5.stl](https://github.com/bitcraze/bitcraze-mechanics/blob/master/models/Landing_pad_v5.stl).
