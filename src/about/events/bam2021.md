### Social Events

####  <i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> Fika {#fk}

We take coffeebreaks very seriously at Bitcraze. This is where we discuss our dreams, issues and crazy ideas for new products. We therefore also wanted to translate these Fika (Swedish for Coffeebreak) moments in our BAM days. So after every workshop and talk we made sure that we have planned in enough time for us to come and connect in our networking area and discuss and talk to each other.

We will be doing this in  [MiBo](https://getmibo.com/). Check out the [event platform information](#event-platform) for more information!

####  <i class="fa fa-gamepad"></i> Quiz {#qz}

A quiz about everything crazyflie and Bitcraze with prices to win, you don't want to miss this!

{% img GoldenFlie; narrow; /images/events/bam2021/goldenflie.png %}

####  <i class="fa fa-group"></i> Community Roundtable Q&A {#cr}
We have a couple of questions to you, our community members! We would like to know your opinion on how we should handle the Crazyflie community, like: How would you like us to communicate our internal plans? How can we make it easier for researchers to contribute? On which social media platforms should we focus on? We hope it will be a fruitfull discussion!

#### <i class="fa fa-glass"></i> Closing Party {#cp}
The BAMdays is a celebration of our 10 year anniversary, so let's socialize and party in one of the Disco MiBo rooms!

Title Presentation: "Fully autonomous CrazyFlie swarms"

{% youtube _8849CvWwqU; medium; 16by9 %}

{% collapse_section Read more %}

Abstract: Swarms of autonomous drones can help humans in search-and-rescue missions, in keeping track of the stock in warehouses or in monitoring crop in greenhouses. We are convinced that such complex tasks can and even should be performed by drones the size of BitCraze's CrazyFlies. Tiny drones like the CrazyFlie are very safe for humans, suitable for flying in narrow environments, and quite cheap so that they can be produced in large numbers. However, it is also notoriously hard to make such tiny drones fly completely autonomously. Due to their extremely low weight, they are very limited in terms of energy and payload. This implies that they can carry few sensors and extremely little processing compared to, e.g., self-driving cars. In our talk, we will talk about the effort at TU Delft's MAVLab to make swarms of tiny autonomous drones, and how we approach this by drawing inspiration from insect intelligence. We will present our work on ultra-light autonomous drones such as the 20 gram "DelFly Explorer". Our focus will be on swarming, and on making tiny drones localize with respect to the other swarm members. We will also talk about two different studies in which swarms of Crazyflies perform incredibly complex tasks. In the first study, a swarm of CrazyFlies is able to explore an unknown environment and come back to the departure point. In the second study, a swarm of CrazyFlies is able to autonomously localize gas sources in complex environments. In our talk we argue that CrazyFlie drones will turn out to be useful far beyond motion tracking arenas.

### Workshops & Demos

*We will also give workshops about the inner workings of the Bitcraze Ecosystem and all beyond! Join if you want to learn more of what makes the Crazyflie tick!*

<center><h4>Day 1</h4> 19th of October</center>

#### Crazyflie and Positioning Systems {#ps}
*11:30 CEST*

We will give a basic introduction to different position systems, how they work and how they fit into the Crazyflie ecosystem. Using different demos we will also be looking at how the Crazyflie performs using different positioning systems as well as some of the strengths and weaknesses of the different technologies. If you’re interested in positioning with the Crazyflie you should definitely join this session!

#### Advanced Lighthouse Usage {#al}
*16:30 CEST*

If you have already gone through [the lighthouse tutorial](/documentation/tutorials/getting-started-with-lighthouse/), but you would like to know what really goes on behind the scenes? In this workshop we will give more advanced knowledge about our newest positioning system. From the Base station's machanics, calibration & geometry estimation, to using Lighthouse Positioning system in a swarm: we will go through it all!

<center><h4>Day 2</h4> 20th of October</center>

#### Autonomy and the App layer {#aa}
*15:00 CEST*

If you want the Crazyflie to fly by itself without any manual involvement, it is important to know the different layers of autonomy and its influence on the communication between the computer and the drone. The App-layer, the ability to have a fully autonomous Crazyflie without any PC communication at all, will be especially highlighted in this workshop. Finally, we will give you some crucial tips on how plan your workflow from abstract ideas to actual autonomous flight.

#### RUST and the Crazyflie {#ru}
*16:00 CEST*

Rust is an exciting, relatively new programming language that promises performance, reliability and productivity. It is starting to become quite popular for system programming and we believe it might finaly be the modern language that can replace C in embedded systems. In this workshop we will quickly go over the language and the different use we can have for it in the Crazyflie ecosystem. Then, we will write the push demo Crazyflie App in Rust to explore how rust can be used in the Crazyflie firmware.

#### Swarming with the CFlib {#sc}
*11:00 CEST*

Controlling a swarm with the cflib, is it possible? And if so, when should you do it? This talk will showcase what the Bitcraze Python library offers in terms of swarm control and what limitations the Python code put on multi-peer communication. We will also show you a demo of swarm flight implemented using under 100 lines of code.

### Event Platform


#### Welkom Platform
{% img WelkomPlatform; medium; /images/events/bam2021/welkomplatform.png %}


For the BAM days we will be using the [Welkom platform](https://welkom.world/en/) which is originally from the Netherlands. We felt that this platfrom had a high emphatize to natural social experience. Moreover, it was very natural interface, so people can navigate through it without an extensive guide.

The platform will contain a mainstage for the keynote talks, rooms for the workshops and networking and the location to all of the social events as well. 

#### Networking in Mibo

{% img WelkomPlatform; narrow; /images/events/bam2021/miboroom.png %}


The Welkom platform we'll use hosts [MiBo](https://getmibo.com/) rooms. It's a spatial chat, where your avatar can run around a 3D world, discovering different environments. Your camera is your head, so you'll need a webcam to join. There are some fun activities around, plenty interactive stuff, from chairs to basketballs. We have used it to for our coffee breaks when we were working from home, and had fun using this world: we'll be happy to meet you there and hope you'll find it fun too. 

Currently we are planning to host two Mibo rooms, one to meet the speakers, available after every workshop and talk, and one to just have a break, explore the work and meet each other.


#### Recommended browsers

Using the latest version of google chrome, microsoft edge or any other chromium browser is advised. Firefox has been reported to work for the regular talks and the event platform, but it will not work for the Mibo intergration.
