We will be going to ERF 2026, March 23rd - 27th in Stavanger, Norway! We will be located at booth #90, come by and talk to us about how the Crazyflie™ works as a scalable testbed for aerial robotics.

### Bitcraze at ERF 2026: A Scalable Testbed for Aerial Robotics

We will demonstrate a live, autonomous indoor flight setup based on the Crazyflie™ platform. The demonstration features multiple nano-drones flying autonomously in a controlled environment and reflects how the platform is used in research and applied robotics development.

At ERF, Bitcraze is there to engage in conversations about platforms, testbeds, and how ambitious aerial robotics ideas can be validated in a financially responsible, safe, and controlled manner. This includes discussions with academic groups, industrial R&D teams, and project partners working across the research-to-application spectrum.

Looking forward to the discussions in Stavanger in booth #90!
