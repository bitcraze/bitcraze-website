{% include teammember.html member="Arnaud Taffanel" role="Developer & Co-founder" img="/images/team/arnaud_taffanel_400px.jpg" bio="
Arnaud has been passionate about technology since his childhood. He has worked in various domains from embedded electronics for medical devices to Linux system integration for mobile phones and was working as an embedded system consultant when he co-founded Bitcraze.

Arnaud likes embedded systems and beautiful code. He likes it best when he is able to design the hardware, write the bootstrap code, and finally design the software that runs on it. He also enjoys playing with bigger systems like the Bitcraze web servers.

{% include teammember.html member="Barbara Rousselot" role="Administration specialist" img="/images/team/barbara_rousselot_400px.jpg" bio="
Growing up in France and all over the world, Barbara has always been interested by helping others and learning from her passions. After her academic and literary education, she wanted to see the world and follow her passion. Along the years, she traveled a lot and obtained a lot of experience in many different fields: administration, community management, sales, even acting. Now she settled down, and uses every bit of what she has learned to deal with everything administration-related and non-technical.

Even though she has no formal education in coding or electronics, as a self-proclaimed geek she has a deep interest in technology and especially in videogames. And when she's not learning to code, she loves to read, knit, and often bakes, to the delight of the other team members!

{% include teammember.html member="Kristoffer Richardsson" role="Developer" img="/images/team/kristoffer_richardsson_400px.jpg" bio="
With a passion for technology, Kristoffer has been working with various aspects of software development for over 20 years. He has worked on all levels, from shifting bits in low level firmware to the architecture of financial systems. In addition to coding, Kristoffer has also a strong interest in how we work, what makes a team tick, what makes us happy, efficient and create fantastic things.

He is a strong believer in lean thinking, the agile movement as well as self organization and he is always looking for improvements. To get a break from software development and logical thinking, Kristoffer can be seen (and heard) from time to time in his tap shoes in the basement. He has taken on the task of spreading the art of tap dance to the rest of the company. He also likes kayaking, skiing, climbing and other outdoor activities, away from the city.

 {% include teammember.html member="Jonas Danielsson" role="Developer" img="/images/team/jonas_danielsson_400px.jpg" bio="
Jonas Danielsson is a software developer with experience of Linux-, open source- and embedded development. He hopes to be involved in developing new features, fixing bugs and finding ways of keeping the product and code in nice shape. One of his favorite quotes: 'People tend to think outside the box while not knowing what is in the box'. As a father of 3 young childern and a owner of cats, those two is most likely that is what he will find ;)

{% include teammember.html member="Marcus Eliasson" role="Developer & Co-founder" img="/images/team/marcus_eliasson_400px.jpg" bio="
At an early age Marcus was always eager to find out how things worked and managed to take apart quite a few toys without being able to put them back together. He’s always been interested in technology, science and engineering, but the focus of his interest has mostly been software development.
After a few years as a Java developer Marcus wanted to change directions in order to get closer to hardware. Mostly doing C and system design, the best spot for him to be in is right between hardware and software, getting the first prototype in your lap and starting to write the firmware for it.

After a few years of embedded systems consulting Marcus founded Bitcraze together with his two friends and colleagues Tobias and Arnaud.
Being an all-rounder Marcus does most things from high level scripting down to low level firmware and hardware design. His favorite thing is being involved in lots of different areas and making a complete system work.

{% include teammember.html member="Kimberly McGuire" role="Developer" img="/images/team/kimberly_mcguire_temp_400px.jpg" bio="
For about 7 years, Kimberly has emerged herself in all things robotics. First she started out with bio-inspired robotics for her masters, to finally making tiny quadcopters fly autonomously for her PhD. That is how she discovered the Crazyflie and loved it so much that she decided to work for Bitcraze. She also has a creative side to her, as she initially started out studying industrial design engineering for her bachelors. Now she still believes that it is important to make products functional and easy to use, and try to visualize everything she is working on.

Kimberly does not want to call herself a specialist but rather an all-rounder, with the capability to dive into problems if needed. she wants to know the entire system before trying to get the Crazyflies to work in the real world. In her spare time, she likes playing tennis, eating Japanese food, watching movies and playing video games.

{% include teammember.html member="Tobias Antonsson" role="Developer & Co-founder" img="/images/team/tobias_antonsson_400px.jpg" bio="
Tobias Antonsson is a born computer and embedded nerd. Ever since he got his first electronics lab kit at an age of eight he has been hooked. He is an all-rounder with experience from computer graphics down to electronic hardware design and thrives best just in between, which makes embedded hardware and software a natural choice.
He loves being creative and a lot of his spare time is being spent on various robotic and R/C projects. One of them, the Crazyflie, has become his livelihood in his co-founded company Bitcraze AB. Work experience includes mobile, medical and electromechanical industries as well as open source/hardware.
