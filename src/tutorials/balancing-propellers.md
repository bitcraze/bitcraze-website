{% si_intro Balancing propellers %}
Well balanced propellers reduce the vibrations in the copter and the noise in the
sensors, improving the stability of the Crazyflie. In most cases there is no 
need to balance the propellers, but if you want to do it this is how it's done.
{% endsi_intro %}

{% si_step preparations %}
You need:

* A small round pin or needle
* Tape. Normal transparent office tape works well
* A pair of scissors
{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step checking the propeller %}
Start by checking if the propeller is well balanced. Do this by
placing a propeller on a needle. Hold the propeller in a horizontal
position and then release it. If it tilts over, it is unbalanced. Balance
the propeller by attaching a small piece of tape on the side that is
pointing upwards.

{% si_step balancing the propeller %}
If the propeller is unbalanced, attach tape to the convex side of the
propeller as shown in the video. The amount of tape that should be used
varies and you might need some tries to find the correct amount.

{% endsi_step %}

{% si_step add more tape if needed %}
After you have placed the first bit of tape try shaking the propellers a
bit. If the propeller isn't tilting over anymore it's balanced.
