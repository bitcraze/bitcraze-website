  abstract={Vision-based deep learning perception fulfills a paramount role in robotics, facilitating solutions to many challenging scenarios, such as acrobatic maneuvers of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and robot-assisted high-precision surgery. Control-oriented end-to-end perception approaches, which directly output control variables for the robot, commonly take advantage of the robot's state estimation as an auxiliary input. When intermediate outputs are estimated and fed to a lower-level controller, i.e., mediated approaches, the robot's state is commonly used as an input only for egocentric tasks, which estimate physical properties of the robot itself. In this work, we propose to apply a similar approach for the first time -- to the best of our knowledge -- to non-egocentric mediated tasks, where the estimated outputs refer to an external subject. We prove how our general methodology improves the regression performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a broad class of non-egocentric 3D pose estimation problems, with minimal computational cost. By analyzing three highly-different use cases, spanning from grasping with a robotic arm to following a human subject with a pocket-sized UAV, our results consistently improve the R{\$}{\$}^{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}regression metric, up to +0.51, compared to their stateless baselines. Finally, we validate the in-field performance of a closed-loop autonomous cm-scale UAV on the human pose estimation task. Our results show a significant reduction, i.e., 24{\%} on average, on the mean absolute error of our stateful CNN, compared to a State-of-the-Art stateless counterpart.},

  abstract = {Palm-sized nano-drones are an appealing class of edge nodes, but their limited computational resources prevent run-ning large deep-learning models onboard. Adopting an edge-fog computational paradigm, we can offload part of the com-putation to the fog; however, this poses security concerns if the fog node, or the communication link, can not be trust. To tackle this concern, we propose a novel distributed edge-fog execution scheme that validates fog computation by re-dundantly executing a random subnetwork aboard our nano-drone. Compared to a State-of-the-Art visual pose estima-tion network that entirely runs onboard, a larger network ex-ecuted in a distributed way improves the R^2 score by +0.19; in case of attack, our approach detects it within 2 s with 95\% probability.},

ABSTRACT = {This article presents a formation tracking control method for the operation of multi-agent systems under disturbances. This study aims to ensure that the followers of a quadcopter converge into the desired formation while the center formation of the follower quadcopters tracks the leader&rsquo;s trajectory within a finite time. The distributed finite-time formation control problem is first investigated using the fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) theory. A disturbance observer is then integrated into the FTSMC to overcome the model uncertainties and bounded disturbances. Subsequently, the Lyapunov function is proposed to ensure the stability of the system. It is shown that formation tracking control can be achieved even in the presence of disturbances. Simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed formation tracking control method compared to existing ones.},

abstract = {As the drone becomes widespread in numerous crucial applications with many powerful functionalities (e.g., reconnaissance and mechanical trigger), there are increasing cases related to misused drones for unethical even criminal activities. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to identify these malicious drones and track their origins using digital forensics. Traditional drone identification techniques for forensics (e.g., RF communication, ID landmarks using a camera, etc.) require high compliance of drones. However, malicious drones will not cooperate or even spoof these identification techniques. Therefore, we present an exploration for a reliable and passive identification approach based on unique hardware traits in drones directly (e.g., analogous to the fingerprint and iris in humans) for forensics purposes. Specifically, we investigate and model the behavior of the parasitic electronic elements under RF interrogation, a particular passive parasitic response modulated by an electronic system on drones, which is distinctive and unlikely to counterfeit. Based on this theory, we design and implement DroneTrace, an end-to-end reliable and passive identification system toward digital drone forensics. DroneTrace comprises a cost-effective millimeter-wave (mmWave) probe, a software framework to extract and process parasitic responses, and a customized deep neural network (DNN)-based algorithm to analyze and identify drones. We evaluate the performance of DroneTrace with 36 commodity drones. Results show that DroneTrace can identify drones with the accuracy of over 99% and an equal error rate (EER) of 0.009, under a 0.1-second sensing time budget. Moreover, we test the reliability, robustness, and performance variation under a set of real-world circumstances, where DroneTrace maintains accuracy of over 98%. DroneTrace is resilient to various attacks and maintains functionality. At its best, DroneTrace has the capacity to identify individual drones at the scale of 104 with less than 5% error.},

abstract = {Recently, there is an increasing demand for small drones owing to their small size and agility in complex indoor environments. Accordingly, safety issues for navigating small drones become of significant importance. For drones to be able to navigate safely through complex environments, it would be useful to estimate accurate time-to-collision (TTC) to obstacles. To this end, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based TTC estimation algorithm. To train generalizable neural networks for TTC estimation, large datasets including collision cases are needed. However, in real-world environments, it is impractical and infeasible to collide drones with obstacles to collect a significant amount of data. Simulation environments could facilitate the data acquisition procedure, but the data from simulated environments could be quite different from those of real environments, which is commonly termed as reality-gap. In this study, to reduce this reality-gap, sim-to-real methods based on a variant of the generative adversarial network are used to convert simulated images into real world-like synthetic images. Besides, to consider the uncertainties that come from using the synthetic dataset, the aleatoric loss function and Monte Carlo dropout method are employed. Furthermore, we improve the performance of the deep learning-based TTC estimation algorithm by replacing conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) layers which are known to be better at handling time-series data than CNNs. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, real flight experiments have been carried out in various indoor environments. Our proposed framework decreases the average TTC estimation error by 0.21 s compared with the baseline approach with CNNs.}

abstract = {This paper presents first advances in the area of aerial chemical trail following. For that purpose, we equipped a palm-size aerial robot, based on the Crazyflie 2.0 quadrocopter, with a small lightweight metal oxide gas sensor for measuring evaporated ethanol from chemical trails. To detect and localize a 5 cm wide chemical trail, a detection criterion was developed that uses only relative changes in the transient phase of the sensor response. The reduction in signal strength dependence improves the robustness of its application. We tested our setup in first crossing-trail experiments showing that our flying ant robot can correlate an odor hit with the chemical trail within 0.14 m. Principally, this could enable aerial chemical trail following in the future.}

In addition, the chosen path, safety, and computational burden are essential for ensuring the successful application of such strategies in the presence of obstacles. In this context, this work introduces a modified potential field method that is capable of providing obstacle avoidance, as well as eliminating local minima problems and oscillations in the influence threshold of repulsive fields. A three-dimensional (3D) vortex field is introduced for this purpose so that each robot can choose the best direction of the vortex field rotation automatically and independently according to its position with respect to each object in the workspace. A scenario that addresses swarm flight with sequential cooperation and the pursuit of moving targets in dynamic environments is proposed. Experimental results are presented and thoroughly discussed using a Crazyflie 2.0 aircraft associated with the loco positioning system for state estimation. It is effectively demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can generate feasible paths while taking into account the aforementioned problems in real-time applications.},

abstract = {Nowadays, aerial and ground robots, wearable and portable devices are becoming smaller, lighter, cheaper, and thus popular. It is now possible to utilize tens and thousands of them to form a swarm to complete complicated cooperative tasks, such as searching, rescuing, mapping, and battling. A swarm usually contains a large number of robots or devices, which are in short distance to each other and may move dynamically. So this paper studies the dynamic and dense swarms. The ultra-wideband (UWB) technology is proposed to serve as the fundamental technique for both networking and localization, because UWB is so time sensitive that an accurate distance can be calculated using timestamps of the transmit and receive data packets. A UWB swarm ranging protocol is designed in this paper, with key features: simple yet efficient, adaptive and robust, scalable and supportive. This swarm ranging protocol is introduced part by part to uncover its support for each of these features. It is implemented on Crazyflie 2.1 drones, STM32 microcontrollers powered aerial robots, with onboard UWB wireless transceiver chips DW1000. Extensive real world experiments are conducted to verify the proposed protocol with a total of 9 Crazyflie drones in a compact area.},

abstract = {The increasing autonomy and presence of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), especially quadrotors, in everyday applications requires in-depth studies of proxemics in Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) and novel methods of user interaction suitable for different distances. This paper presents a user study (N=32) that evaluates proxemics with a miniature quadrotor (92 mm wheelbase) from four directions (front, back, left, right) in a seated setting investigating preferred approach directions and distances in future home or workplace scenarios. The goal of this study is to determine if humans are willing to allow flying robots of that size and mechanical appearance to approach close enough to enable tactile interaction. Moreover, the participants' inclination to physically interact with the quadrotor is examined. Studies evaluating proxemics in HDI are highly dependent on repeatable results and actually flying robots. In most comparable studies, the quadrotors used did not fly freely or at all, but were moved, manually controlled, or flew barely repeatable trajectories due to unstable onboard navigation. Only few studies have used pose estimation systems that ensure smooth and reproducible trajectories and thus reliable findings of the studies. For this reason, in addition to the presented study and its results, an insight into the used testbed is provided, that also integrates full skeleton pose estimation rather than tracking participants with only a single marker.},

abstract = {In this thesis we develop a new swarm control platform (that can function as either a Centralized or Distributed system), as well as potential research applications and educational exercises that can be created using this platform. The platform utilizes an open source Nano-Quadcopter called the Crazyflie and uses the OptiTrack motion capture camera system for localization. It is designed for scalability using the Virtual Reality Peripheral Network (VRPN), a type of Multi-Cast UDP protocol, to transmit localization data. We use this location data and set of nine nested PID controllers to command the Crazyflie to any location in space. It also supports flying multiple Crazyflies on one USB Radio, and multiple radios per computer, further reducing the scale up cost. As a proof of concept, we crafted a few applications for the Platform to demonstrate its abilities. These examples range from simple single Crazyflie autonomous flight, to more complex gesture controlled multi-Crazyflie master-slave ‘follow-the-leader' type systems. We intend to extend these systems to test even more complex problems in optimization and stochastic lossy networks, as well as creating lab experiments and educational resources for students to learn more about controls. Based around C and C++, the objective of this platform is to provide an accessible and quick tool to researchers and professors to craft unique and interesting hands-on experiences in distributed control systems.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are fueling the advancement of autonomous palm-sized drones, i.e., nano-drones, despite their limited power envelope and onboard processing capabilities. Computationally lighter than traditional geometrical approaches, CNNs are the ideal candidates to predict end-to-end signals directly from the sensor inputs to feed to the onboard flight controller. However, these sophisticated CNNs require significant complexity reduction and fine-grained tuning to be successfully deployed aboard a flying nano-drone. To date, these optimizations are mostly hand-crafted and require error-prone, labor-intensive iterative development flows. This work discusses methodologies and software tools to streamline and automate all the deployment stages on a low-power commercial multicore System-on-Chip. We investigate both an industrial closed-source and an academic open-source tool-set with a field-proofed state-of-the-art CNN for autonomous driving. Our results show a 2 reduction of the memory footprint and a speedup of 1.6 in the inference time, compared to the original hand-crafted CNN, with the same prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {The advances in computer processor technology have enabled the application of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to agile systems, such as quadrotors. These systems are characterized by their underactuation, nonlinearities, bounded inputs, and time-delays. Classical control solutions fall short in overcoming these difficulties and fully exploiting the capabilities offered by such platforms. This paper presents the design and implementation of an efficient position controller for quadrotors based on real-time NMPC with time-delay compensation and bounds enforcement on the actuators. To deal with the limited computational resources onboard, an offboard control architecture is proposed. It is implemented using the high-performance software package acadoff, which solves optimal control problems and implements a real-time iteration (RTI) variant of a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) scheme with Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation. The quadratic subproblems (QP) in the SQP scheme are solved with HPIPM, an interior-point method solver, built on top of the linear algebra library BLASFEO, finely tuned for multiple CPU architectures. Solution times are further reduced by reformulating the QPs using the efficient partial condensing algorithm implemented in HPIPM. We demonstrate the capabilities of our architecture using the Crazyflie 2.1 nano-quadrotor.},

We derive a clock synchronization scheme for the radio modules, show how each module is able to compute its position within the network, and finally demonstrate how multiple robots are able to operate simultaneously within the space by using time-difference-of-arrival measurements to localize themselves. Since robots are passive receivers in this system and are able to compute their position based only on received and local information, multiple robots can operate simultaneously and without the need for central coordination or centralized localization infrastructure. All results presented in this paper are supported by experimental results, and the functionality of the system is demonstrated by multiple micro-quadrocopters localizing and flying simultaneously within a space.},

abstract = {The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) is expanding to commercial, scientific, and agriculture applications, including surveillance, product deliveries and aerial photography. One challenge for applications of drones is detecting obstacles and avoiding collisions. A typical solution to this issue is the use of camera sensors or ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection or sometimes just manual control (teleoperation). However, these solutions have costs in battery lifetime, payload, operator skill. We note that there will be an air disturbance in the vicinity of the drone when it's moving close to obstacles or other drones. Our objective is to detect obstacles from monitoring the aforementioned air disturbance, by analyzing the data from the drone's gyroscope and accelerometer. Results from three experiments using the Crazyflie 2 micro drone are reported here. We show that it is possible to reliably detect when a drone is passing under another using by using data mining algorithms to recognize the air disturbance caused by the other drone.},

This work builds on a recent development called FaSTrack in which a slow offline computation provides a modular safety guarantee for a faster online planner. We introduce the notion of 'meta-planning' in which a refined offline computation enables safe switching between different online planners. This provides autonomous systems with the ability to adapt motion plans to a priori unknown environments in real-time as sensor measurements detect new obstacles, and the flexibility to maneuver differently in the presence of obstacles than they would in free space, all while maintaining a strict safety guarantee. We demonstrate the meta-planning algorithm both in simulation and in hardware using a small Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor.},

abstract = {Perching on a vertical surface carries the risk of severe damage to the vehicle if the maneuver fails, especially if failure goes undetected. We present a detection method using an onboard 3-axis accelerometer to discriminate between perching success and failure. An analytical model was developed to calculate acceleration differences for success and failure and set decision times. Two distinct decision times were shown to be effective, corresponding to properly engaging the gripper and overloading the gripper's capabilities. According to a machine learning feature selection algorithm, the maximum Z axis acceleration of the quadrotor and the presence of near-zero readings are the most relevant features within these two time frames. Using these features, the detection algorithm discriminated between success and failure with a 91% accuracy at 40 ms, and 94% at 80 ms. Real-time detection and failure recovery experiments with a 20 g quadrotor verify the detection method. An improved approach that combines various decision times correctly identified success/failure for all 20 trials with an average total falling distance of 0.8m during recovery. We discuss the feasibility of extending our method to other quadrotor platforms.},

Thus, the combination of challenging swarm strategy and human-drone collaboration aims to make the games with machines tangible and interactive. Although some research on AI for board games already exists, e.g., chess, the SwarmPlay technology has the potential to offer much more engagement and interaction with the user as it proposes a multi-agent swarm instead of a single interactive robot. We explore user's evaluation of RL-based swarm behavior in comparison with the game theory-based behavior. The preliminary user study revealed that participants were highly engaged in the game with drones (70% put a maximum score on the Likert scale) and found it less artificial compared to the regular computer-based systems (80%). The affection of the user's game perception from its outcome was analyzed and put under discussion.

The optimization process only requires the inputs and outputs of the filter without ground truth. Experiments were conducted with the Crazyflie quadrotor, and all parameters of the extended Kalman filter are well tuned after one 10-s manual flight. The proposed method has multiple advantages, of which we demonstrate two experimentally. First, the learned parameters are suitable for each individual drone, even if their particular sensors deviate from the standard, e.g., by being noisier. Second, this manner of self-tuning allows one to effortlessly expand filters when new sensors or better drone models become available. The learned parameters result in a better state estimation performance than the standard Crazyflie parameters.},

Our approach avoids the oversimplifying abstractions found in many planning methods, while retaining the expressiveness of missions encoded in STL allowing us to handle complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements.

abstract = {Research on multi-agent systems of UAVs is of growing interest in the research community, with specific interest in the testing of novel algorithms on actual systems. Many existing testbeds already exist, but the majority of them utilize expensive quadrotors for their agents. With the recent surge in interest from consumers, companies have started to market lower cost quadrotor options. One such option is the Crazyflie 2.0 from Bitcraze. This quadrotor measures just 10cm from rotor to rotor, uses open-source firmware, and has developed a strong community backing. This work develops a multi-agent testbed using the Crazyflie 2.0. This work presents a parameterization of the Crazyflie quadrotor so it can be modeled and have more advanced controllers designed for it. Additionally, this work discusses the default control loop of the Crazyflie 2.0. Then nested-loop PID controllers are designed and compared against the simulated physics model. A software system that is capable of controlling multiple flying Crazyflie's is also presented. This system is also capable of modifying the controller at runtime, and implementing distributed computation on the Crazyflie. Finally, a novel algorithm for localization of a target object using distance-only measurements is presented. This algorithm uses optimization dynamics to solve a non-convex QCQP formulation of the problem in a distributed manner. The algorithm is presented and then implemented using the distributed computation framework presented in this work.},

abstract = {Multirotor copters with full six Degree of Freedom (DoF) maneuvering are often overactuated. The control allocation of overactuated UAV platforms can have an infinite number of solutions due to their redundancy. The most common allocation framework is based on Force Decomposition (FD), which provides a robust least-square solution and is easy to implement, but it does not account for input constraints. A control allocation framework based on Quadratic Programming (QP) can take input constraints; however, it will introduce linear approximation error and it has not been formulated and implemented on physical systems. In this letter, we propose a nullspace-based allocation framework for overactuated UAV platforms that combines the advantages of the FD-based framework and QP-based framework. Our proposed nullspace-based framework can take input constraints while eliminating the linear approximation error in the control allocation. It is also robust against controller sampling frequency and measurement noise. These three allocation frameworks are implemented and compared on our novel overactuated UAV platform in simulation to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method and in experiment for a vertical rotation trajectory to demonstrate its performance.},

abstract = {Increasing the computational efficiency of attitude estimation is a critical problem related to modern spacecraft, especially for those with limited computing resources. In this paper, a computationally efficient nonlinear attitude estimation strategy based on the vector observations is proposed. The Rodrigues parameter is chosen as the local error attitude parameter, to maintain the normalization constraint for the quaternion in the global estimator. The proposed attitude estimator is performed in four stages. First, the local attitude estimation error system is described by a polytopic linear model. Then the local error attitude estimator is designed with constant coefficients based on the robust H 2 filtering algorithm. Subsequently, the attitude predictions and the local error attitude estimations are calculated by a gyro based model and the local error attitude estimator. Finally, the attitude estimations are updated by the predicted attitude with the local error attitude estimations. Since the local error attitude estimator is with constant coefficients, it does not need to calculate the matrix inversion for the filter gain matrix or update the Jacobian matrixes online to obtain the local error attitude estimations. As a result, the computational complexity of the proposed attitude estimator reduces significantly. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed attitude estimation strategy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Bing Liu et al.},

It can be considered to be the quadrotor equivalent of sniffing behavior. The Crazyflie-based system was used to characterize the likelihood and power consumption for detection of an odor plume across various rotor-induced flow conditions. Results indicate that rotor-induced airflow increases the detection count by 18.5X while incurring modest increases in power consumption. When the additional power is taken into consideration, detection performance increases more than the power over the entire Pareto front, with a ratio as high as 3.5X under optimal conditions. We conclude that rotor-induced airflow supports a power-aware approach for odor source detection.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a multi-UAV coordination methodology with trajectory synchronization between the coordination, planning, and control layers. We use probabilistic trajectory mappings (PTM) to find collision-free trajectories through the obstacles. For trajectory tracking, we apply the differential flatness modeling, allowing us to directly map the desired output trajectory, which is parameterized with cubic B-Spline, into the required input sequence. The local support property of B-Splines enables to re-plan of the trajectories without deteriorating entire the shape of the path and the continuity over it. Through this fashion, the trajectory tracking controller generates a required input sequence for given velocity references over the B-Spline sequences, which can be performed by the vehicle. The coordination between the multi-UAV is provided through time synchronization between the trajectories, which are parameterized with B-Splines knot scales and their projected derivatives. We performed experiments in a realistic environment under a motion capture system with multiple nano-size aerial vehicles. The results are given to show the success of the presented methodology for challenging problems such as passing through a small virtual circle in the air for given time sequences.},

abstract = {Drone teleoperation is usually accomplished using remote radio controllers, devices that can be hard to master for inexperienced users. Moreover, the limited amount of information fed back to the user about the robot's state, often limited to vision, can represent a bottleneck for operation in several conditions. In this work, we present a wearable interface for drone teleoperation and its evaluation through a user study. The two main features of the proposed system are a data glove to allow the user to control the drone trajectory by hand motion and a haptic system used to augment their awareness of the environment surrounding the robot. This interface can be employed for the operation of robotic systems in line of sight (LoS) by inexperienced operators and allows them to safely perform tasks common in inspection and search-and-rescue missions such as approaching walls and crossing narrow passages with limited visibility conditions. In addition to the design and implementation of the wearable interface, we performed a systematic study to assess the effectiveness of the system through three user studies (n = 36) to evaluate the users' learning path and their ability to perform tasks with limited visibility. We validated our ideas in both a simulated and a real-world environment. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system can improve teleoperation performance in different cases compared to standard remote controllers, making it a viable alternative to standard Human-Robot Interfaces.},

abstract = {We present a new experimental method for the generation and real-time implementation of high-speed aerobatic maneuvers, including multiple flips, on a 19-gram autonomous quadrotor. A key element in the proposed approach is the design and experimental tuning of a gain scheduling control strategy in which two linear time-invariant (LTI) controllers are alternatingly activated and deactivated to switch between a normal flight mode and an aerobatic mode, enabling the flyer to perform consecutive multiple flips in a robustly stable manner. The implementation of the controllers is done using on-board power, sensors and computing capabilities, so that the quadrotor remains fully autonomous during flight. Notably, the attainment of autonomy, using real-time control, is made possible by the development of a new method for speed planning based on cubic functions, the geometric generalization of the notion of multi-flip and the empirical identification of the flyer's dynamics, required for trajectory generation and controller synthesis. Compelling experimental results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach. In particular, we present maneuvers that include consecutive single, double, and triple flips about the flyer's roll principal axis and a non-principal axis. To the best of our knowledge, to this date, the flyer used in this research is the smallest controlled quadrotor to have autonomously accomplished three consecutive flips while remaining stable.},

We also compare our strategy to a simple finite state machine (FSM), geared towards efficient exploration, and demonstrate that our policy is more robust and resilient at obstacle avoidance as well as up to 70% more efficient in source seeking.

It ismeant to be a development platform and is therefore open source as well as open hardware. Currently some research is being undertaken on point-to-point distance measure- ments using ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors at the Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC). Due to its light weight and small size, the Crazyflie was chosen as a demonstration tool for this technology. In the future these quadrocopters should be used to demonstrate the achievements of the research mentioned above at as well as outside of the ETH. For this purpose the estimation and control algorithms that are already included in Bitcraze's firmware for the Crazyflie have to be replaced. The goal of this bachelor thesis, documented in this report, was to determine the system pa- rameters that will be needed in order to design the new estimation and control algorithms. These are all moments of inertia of the quadrocopter, thrust maps and the transfer function of the motors as well as the drag coefficients of the Crazyflie. The physical parameters of the Crazyflie 2.0 nano quadrocopter and the exper- iments that were used to determine them are presented. Firstly, to measure the coefficients of the inertia matrix, the relationship between the moment of inertia and the period of a pendulum was made use of. Secondly, a set of motor param- eter mappings between motor input command, produced thrust and torque and the rotor's angular velocities was determined using a force/torque sensor and a laser tachometer. In addition, a transfer function for the motors was identified by applying sinusoidal inputs to the motors. Thirdly, the quadrocopter's drag coefficients that characterize the force acting on the rotating propellers when the quadrocopter is moving in air were determined. For this, air was blown onto the Crazyflie while it was mounted to the force/torque sensor. Finally, the experimental methods for determining the inertia matrix and the motor parameter mappings were verified using appropriate experiments.},

abstract = {Swarms of tiny flying robots hold great potential for exploring unknown, indoor environments. Their small size allows them to move in narrow spaces, and their light weight makes them safe for operating around humans. Until now, this task has been out of reach due to the lack of adequate navigation strategies. The absence of external infrastructure implies that any positioning attempts must be performed by the robots themselves. State-of-the-art solutions, such as simultaneous localization and mapping, are still too resource demanding. This article presents the swarm gradient bug algorithm (SGBA), a minimal navigation solution that allows a swarm of tiny flying robots to autonomously explore an unknown environment and subsequently come back to the departure point. SGBA maximizes coverage by having robots travel in different directions away from the departure point. The robots navigate the environment and deal with static obstacles on the fly by means of visual odometry and wall-following behaviors. Moreover, they communicate with each other to avoid collisions and maximize search efficiency. To come back to the departure point, the robots perform a gradient search toward a home beacon. We studied the collective aspects of SGBA, demonstrating that it allows a group of 33-g commercial off-the-shelf quadrotors to successfully explore a real-world environment. The application potential is illustrated by a proof-of-concept search-and-rescue mission in which the robots captured images to find “victims” in an office environment. The developed algorithms generalize to other robot types and lay the basis for tackling other similarly complex missions with robot swarms in the future.},

Here, the resulting real-time closed-loop scheme employs a linear time-invariant (LTI) controller that stabilizes the nonlinear unstable dynamics of the open-loop system while enabling high performance during aggressive flight. In this approach, we define a parameterized quadratic proto-Lyapunov function associated with the nonautonomous closed-loop flyer's dynamics that, for a set of feasible parameters, becomes Lyapunov. This parameterization allows for the synthesis and selection of stabilizing controllers which are tested through numerical simulation, employing an open-loop plant model obtained from first principles and simple system identification experiments.

The second is the use of a new, advanced 4FLY Simulator in order to utilize the MATLAB{\textregistered}/Simulink environment to easily implement a mathematical model of Crazyflie 2.0 dynamics, as well as for a synthesis of various types of controllers with support of OpenGL cross-language in the visualization of simulations results. The 4FLYSimulator allows to test autonomous flights (and landings) with obstacles avoidance and to conduct learning and teaching the basics of Crazyflie 2.0 piloting. In the third aspect the authors outlined promising, preliminary results obtained in control of flying robot by pointing device (positioner) and with the support of a vision system, which basis only on a single Kinect sensor.},

abstract = {Effective autonomous indoor flight requires an ability to sense and navigate ground, ceiling, and walls. While this can be accomplished in many ways including vision, one bio-inspired approach that is not well studied uses the detection of pressure changes when flying close to surfaces. As an example, an increase in pressure can be detected when a quadrotor flies close to the ground, a phenomenon known as 'ground effect'. This work evaluates the viability of differential pressure measurements as a means of sensing ground, ceilings, and walls for small quadrotors. Extending existing models for thrust in ground effect, a model is derived to predict pressure changes due to ground effect in hover and tilt. The pressure response with ground effect is characterized across a range of distances, thrust levels, sensor locations, and quadrotor tilts using a Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor and a small MEMS differential pressure sensor. Characterization experiments are also used to evaluate pressure measurements at varying distances from ceilings and walls, as well as the pressure behavior due to step changes in ground height. Manually controlled free flight tests are used to validate ground sensing in both nominal and visually challenging environments, as well as wall sensing in free flight.},

abstract = {Many biological organisms (e.g. insects, birds, and mammals) rely on the perception of an informational variable called time-to-contact (TTC) to control their motion for various tasks such as avoiding obstacles, landing, or interception. TTC, defined as the required time to contact an object if the current velocity is maintained, has been recently leveraged for robot motion control in various tasks. However, most existing robotic applications of TTC simply control the TTC to be constant or constantly decreasing, without fully exploring the applicability for TTC. In this paper, we propose two-stage TTC based strategies and apply them to aerial robotic perching. With the proposed strategies, we can generate reference trajectories for TTC to realize the non-zero contact velocity required by perching, which is impossible for constant or constantly decreasing TTC strategy, but of critical importance for robust perching performance. We conduct simulations to verify the superiority of the proposed strategies in terms of shorter time for perching and satisfying more constraints. Further, with properly designed controllers, we perform experiments on a palm-size quadcopter to track the planned reference trajectories and realize aerial robotic perching. The research presented in this paper can be readily applied to the control of flying robot for perching with visual feedback, and can inspire more alternative forms of TTC based planning and control for robotic applications.},

This is achieved by efficiently applying semi-implicit time integration for evolving the path and secondly by developing a methodology for setting the algorithm's parameters based on physical quantities.

abstract = {In the design and implementation of networked multiagent systems, it is essential not only to guarantee closed-loop system stability but also to schedule interagent information exchange in order to prevent potential network overload and decrease wireless communication costs. For stably scheduling information exchange in networked multiagent systems, the contribution of this article is threefold. We first present a new event-triggered distributed control architecture predicated on a dynamic threshold, which involves an error signal between the state of an agent and the state of its reference model as well as an exponentially decaying term, to schedule interagent information exchange. Building upon the first contribution and in contrast to the standard sampled data exchange viewpoint when an event occurs, second, we propose a method entitled solution-predictor curve. In particular, this method approximates the solution trajectory related to information exchange, where every agent stores this curve and distributively exchanges its parameters when an event occurs. Its key feature is that each agent utilizes the resulting solution trajectory over the time interval until the next event occurs, where it has the capability to further reduce interagent information exchange compared with the sampled data case. A system-theoretical stability analysis of the proposed event-triggered distributed control architecture is given, which captures both sampled data and solution-predictor curve cases, and practical guidelines on the selection of parameter tuning parameters are also stated. As the third contribution, we demonstrate the efficacy of our theoretical results in laboratory-level experiments.},

Mathematically, these interactions are represented with potential fields. Despite their explanatory success, these models fail to guarantee rapid and safe collective motion when applied to aerial robotic swarms flying in cluttered environments of the real world, such as forests and urban areas. Moreover, these models necessitate a tight coupling with the deployment scenarios to induce consistent swarm behaviours. Here, we propose a predictive model that incorporates the local principles of potential field models in an objective function and optimizes those principles under the knowledge of the agents' dynamics and environment. We show that our approach improves the speed, order and safety of the swarm, it is independent of the environment layout and is scalable in the swarm speed and inter-agent distance. Our model is validated with a swarm of five quadrotors that can successfully navigate in a real-world indoor environment populated with obstacles.},

Then, the backstepping-like design methodology is presented to derive a local tracking controller for each UAV such that its position and yaw angle can converge to the reference ones. The proposed protocol is distributed in the sense that, the input update of each UAV dynamically relies only on local state information from its neighborhood set and the constraints, and it does not require any additional centralized information. It is demonstrated that under the proposed protocol, all UAVs reach consensus without violation of the environmental constraints.

abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning provides a promising approach for vision-based control of real-world robots. However, the generalization of such models depends critically on the quantity and variety of data available for training. This data can be difficult to obtain for some types of robotic systems, such as fragile, small-scale quadrotors. Simulated rendering and physics can provide for much larger datasets, but such data is inherently of lower quality: many of the phenomena that make the real-world autonomous flight problem challenging, such as complex physics and air currents, are modeled poorly or not at all, and the systematic differences between simulation and the real world are typically impossible to eliminate. In this work, we investigate how data from both simulation and the real world can be combined in a hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Our method uses real-world data to learn about the dynamics of the system, and simulated data to learn a generalizable perception system that can enable the robot to avoid collisions using only a monocular camera. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world nano aerial vehicle collision avoidance task, showing that with only an hour of real-world data, the quadrotor can avoid collisions in new environments with various lighting conditions and geometry.

abstract = {Complex service robotics scenarios entail unpredictable task appearance both in space and time. This requires robots to continuously relocate and imposes a trade-off between motion costs and efficiency in task execution. In such scenarios, multi-robot systems and even swarms of robots can be exploited to service different areas in parallel. An efficient deployment needs to continuously determine the best allocation according to the actual service needs, while also taking relocation costs into account when such allocation must be modified. For large scale problems, centrally predicting optimal allocations and movement paths for each robot quickly becomes infeasible. Instead, decentralized solutions are needed that allow the robotic system to self-organize and adaptively respond to the task demands. In this paper, we propose a distributed and asynchronous approach to simultaneous task assignment and path planning for robot swarms, which combines a bio-inspired collective decision-making process for the allocation of robots to areas to be serviced, and a search-based path planning approach for the actual routing of robots towards tasks to be executed. Task allocation exploits a hierarchical representation of the workspace, supporting the robot deployment to the areas that mostly require service. We investigate four realistic environments of increasing complexity, where each task requires a robot to reach a location and work for a specific amount of time. The proposed approach improves over two different baseline algorithms in specific settings with statistical significance, while showing consistently good results overall. Moreover, the proposed solution is robust to limited communication and robot failures.},

Ultra-wideband (UWB) time difference of arrival (TDOA)-based localization is a promising lightweight, low-cost solution that can scale to a large number of devices - making it especially suited for resource-constrained multi-robot applications. However, the localization accuracy of standard, commercially available UWB radios is often insufficient due to significant measurement bias and outliers. In this letter, we address these issues by proposing a robust UWB TDOA localization framework comprising of (i) learning-based bias correction and (ii) M-estimation-based robust filtering to handle outliers. The key properties of our approach are that (i) the learned biases generalize to different UWB anchor setups and (ii) the approach is computationally efficient enough to run on resource-constrained hardware. We demonstrate our approach on a Crazyflie nano-quadcopter. Experimental results show that the proposed localization framework, relying only on the onboard IMU and UWB, provides an average of 42.08% localization error reduction (in three different anchor setups) compared to the baseline approach without bias compensation. We also show autonomous trajectory tracking on a quadcopter using our UWB TDOA localization approach.},

Here a second-order homogenous relay free controller is designed for trajectory tracking, which is easy to develop and also exhibits the property of fast convergence. Next, to mitigate the disturbance of the system, a second-order homogenous super twisting based disturbance observer is clubbed with the relay free controller. The stability of the proposed controller and disturbance observer is derived using Polya's method. Furthermore, for reducing the controller's effort and the disturbance observer effort, SOStools are used for finding the threshold on event-triggering error. Using event-triggering conditions allowable number of packet-dropouts from controller to plant side are also derived. Simulation Results shows that the proposed controller performs better than the existing fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control (FNTSMC).

These strategies are then extended into the case where the intruder travels faster. Crazyflie 2.1 is used as an experimental platform to test the proposed strategy. For fixed defender locations, a barrier line can be found such that the intruder is guaranteed to be captured outside the target area if it starts beyond.},

Our method decomposes the planning problem into two stages: a discrete planner operating on a graph representation of the workspace, and a continuous refinement that converts the non-smooth graph plan into a set of Ck-continuous trajectories, locally optimizing an integral-squared-derivative cost. We account for the downwash effect, allowing safe flight in dense formations. We demonstrate the computational efficiency in simulation with up to 200 robots and the physical plausibility with an experiment with 32 nano-quadrotors. Our approach can compute safe and smooth trajectories for hundreds of quadrotors in dense environments with obstacles in a few minutes.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an exploration strategy in unknown environments for a team of quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Based on the frontier information, the proposed strategy builds a roadmap of the explored area in form of a Sensor-based Selective Graph (SSG) using simple data trees of the frontier and the hub node only. In particular, the frontier data tree is utilized to consider the adjacent frontier sectors as one frontier sector, and the next target node is generated maximizing the coverage of frontiers at each movement of quadrotors. In addition, to expand the proposed strategy to the three dimensional (3D) workspace with quadrotors, a Multiple Flight Levels (MFL) approach is proposed to increase the efficiency of the exploration. Moreover, when a quadrotor reaches a dead end where no frontier exists, the efficient backtracking algorithm chooses the best path to backtrack efficiently with a graph map provided by the SSG. With these contributions, we successfully develop the frontier-based exploration strategy for multiple quadrotors, and performance of the overall approach is validated by numerical simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {Designing effective low-level robot controllers often entail platform-specific implementations that require manual heuristic parameter tuning, significant system knowledge, or long design times. With the rising number of robotic and mechatronic systems deployed across areas ranging from industrial automation to intelligent toys, the need for a general approach to generating low-level controllers is increasing. To address the challenge of rapidly generating low-level controllers, we argue for using model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) trained on relatively small amounts of automatically generated (i.e., without system simulation) data. In this letter, we explore the capabilities of MBRL on a Crazyflie centimeter-scale quadrotor with rapid dynamics to predict and control at ≤50 Hz. To our knowledge, this is the first use of MBRL for controlled hover of a quadrotor using only on-board sensors, direct motor input signals, and no initial dynamics knowledge. Our controller leverages rapid simulation of a neural network forward dynamics model on a graphic processing unit enabled base station, which then transmits the best current action to the quadrotor firmware via radio. In our experiments, the quadrotor achieved hovering capability of up to 6 s with 3 min of experimental training data.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the challenging problem of chasing an escaping target using a quadrotor in cluttered environments. To tackle these challenges, we propose a guided time-optimal model predictive control (GTO-MPC) based practical framework to generate chasing trajectories for the quadrotor. A jerk limited approach is first adopted to find a time-optimal jerk limited trajectory (JLT), an initial reference for the quadrotor to track, without taking into account surrounding obstacles and potential threats. An MPC based replanning framework is then applied to approximate the JLT together with the consideration of other issues such as flight safety, line-of-sight maintenance, and deadlock avoidance. Combined with a neural network, the proposed GTO-MPC framework can efficiently generate chasing trajectories that guarantee flight smoothness and kinodynamic feasibility. Our simulation and actual experimental results show that the proposed technique is highly effective.},

abstract = {Vector-borne diseases have a major impact in mortality and morbidity throughout the tropics. Vector-borne pathogens are transmitted to humans by blood feeding arthropods like mosquitoes and ticks. A true understanding of the vector-borne disease cycle requires the study of the major players involved in this cycle: the mammalian host, the pathogen and the arthropod vector. This thesis examines these aspects by using a tick-borne disease – human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) – as a model. Chapters 1, 2 and 3 emphasize the importance of vector-borne diseases and discuss medically relevant arthropod vectors in light of their immune response to human pathogens. The etiologic agent of HGA, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is also examined in detail, with a focus on immune evasion strategies used to colonize mammals and ticks. Chapters 4 thru 6 are dedicated to address pathogen, host and the tick vector, respectively. First, the contribution of one A. phagocytophilum gene – the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase – to infection is demonstrated. Next, the role of tick saliva as an immunomodulator of A. phagocytophilum infection in the mammalian host is revealed. Finally, an Ixodes scapularis X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein is described as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls tick colonization by A. phagocytophilum. In summary, this dissertation uncovers three distinct events underlying the tick-pathogen-host interface.},

Nanomaterials have emerged as extremely promising candidates for this technology due to their inherent low-dimensional nature and high surface-to-volume ratio. Among these, nanoscale silicon is of great interest because pristine silicon is largely inert on its own in the context of gas sensing, unless functionalized with an appropriate gas-sensitive material. We report a chemical-sensitive field-effect transistor (CS-FET) platform based on 3.5-nm-thin silicon channel transistors. Using industry-compatible processing techniques, the conventional electrically active gate stack is replaced by an ultrathin chemical-sensitive layer that is electrically nonconducting and coupled to the 3.5-nm-thin silicon channel. We demonstrate a low-power, sensitive, and selective multiplexed gas sensing technology using this platform by detecting H2S, H2, and NO2 at room temperature for environment, health, and safety in the oil and gas industry, offering significant advantages over existing technology. Moreover, the system described here can be readily integrated with mobile electronics for distributed sensor networks in environmental pollution mapping and personal air-quality monitors.},

However, their extremely restricted sensors and computational resources make GSL a daunting challenge. In this work, we propose a novel bug algorithm named `Sniffy Bug', which allows a fully autonomous swarm of gas-seeking nano quadcopters to localize a gas source in an unknown, cluttered and GPS-denied environments. The computationally efficient, mapless algorithm foresees in the avoidance of obstacles and other swarm members, while pursuing desired waypoints. The waypoints are first set for exploration, and, when a single swarm member has sensed the gas, by a particle swarm optimization-based procedure. We evolve all the parameters of the bug (and PSO) algorithm, using our novel simulation pipeline, `AutoGDM'. It builds on and expands open source tools in order to enable fully automated end-to-end environment generation and gas dispersion modeling, allowing for learning in simulation. Flight tests show that Sniffy Bug with evolved parameters outperforms manually selected parameters in cluttered, real-world environments.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present Neural-Swarm, a nonlinear decentralized stable controller for close-proximity flight of multirotor swarms. Close-proximity control is challenging due to the complex aerodynamic interaction effects between multirotors, such as downwash from higher vehicles to lower ones. Conventional methods often fail to properly capture these interaction effects, resulting in controllers that must maintain large safety distances between vehicles, and thus are not capable of close-proximity flight. Our approach combines a nominal dynamics model with a regularized permutation-invariant Deep Neural Network (DNN) that accurately learns the high-order multi-vehicle interactions. We design a stable nonlinear tracking controller using the learned model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed controller significantly outperforms a baseline nonlinear tracking controller with up to four times smaller worst-case height tracking errors. We also empirically demonstrate the ability of our learned model to generalize to larger swarm sizes.},

We present a vertically integrated approach starting from the DNN model design, training, and dataset augmentation down to 8-bit quantization and deployment in-field. PULP-Frontnet can operate in real-time (up to 135frame/), consuming less than 87 for processing at peak throughput and down to 0.43/frame in the most energy-efficient operating point. Field experiments demonstrate a closed-loop top-notch autonomous navigation capability, with a tiny 27-grams Crazyflie 2.1 nano-UAV.

The presented module uses dilated convolutions to systematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information without losing resolution. The architecture is based on the fact that dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field without loss of resolution or coverage. We show that the presented context module increases the accuracy of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation systems.

abstract = {Small aerial robots usually face a common challenge: they can only fly for a short time due to their limited onboard energy supply. To tackle this issue, one promising solution is to endow flying robots with perching capability so that they can perch or land on walls, trees, or power lines to rest or recharge. Such perching capability is especially useful for monitoring-related tasks since the robot can maintain a desired height for monitoring without flying. One of the major challenges for perching is to design a light-weight and energy-efficient perching mechanism. In this paper, we present a 3D-printed compliant bistable gripper which is easy to close, stable to hold, and easy to adjust for a palm-size quadcopter to perch on cylindrical objects. If installed on the bottom of aerial robots, it can also be used for aerial grasping. The gripper can be directly activated by the impact force during contact to switch from open state to closed state. It can also hold the quadcopter safely since the required force to open the gripper is larger than the robot weight. We analyze the required forces for closing and opening to provide design guidelines for the mechanism. Experimental results show that the designed gripper can successful make the quadcopter perch on cylinders as well as grasp objects.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for online trajectory planning in known environments. The proposed algorithm is a fusion of sampling-based techniques and model-based optimization via quadratic programming. The former is used to efficiently generate an obstacle-free path while the latter takes into account the robot dynamical constraints to generate a time-dependent trajectory. The main contribution of this work lies on the formulation of a convex optimization problem over the generated obstacle-free path that is guaranteed to be feasible. Thus, in contrast with previously proposed methods, iterative formulations are not required. The proposed method has been compared with state-of-the-art approaches showing a significant improvement in success rate and computation time. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach for online planning, the proposed method was applied to the fluid autonomous navigation of a quadcopter in multiple environments consisting of up to 200 obstacles. The scenarios hereinafter presented are some of the most densely cluttered experiments for online planning and navigation reported to date.

abstract = {The growth of the micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) industry is outpacing our understanding of how MAVs behave in cluttered environments. Search and rescue and product delivery (two key MAV applications) occur in tight, confined spaces filled with complex obstacles. Our current understanding of how micro-quadrotors interact with boundaries is based primarily on helicopter models, which were designed for high-Reynolds-number single-rotor flows. To test how well existing near-boundary models apply to micro-quadrotors, the thrust forces and wakes of a micro-quadrotor near a ground, ceiling, and sidewall were measured. It is found that micro-quadrotors (like their larger counterparts) experience a large boost in lift near the ground/ceiling and a slight drop in lift near the sidewall. Particle image velocimetry is used to quantify the velocity around the rotors and evaluate the assumptions made by existing ground and ceiling models. Complex boundary-layer interactions were observed at low altitudes, especially when the quadrotor was tilted relative to the ground. Reduced-order modeling was also used to explore the safety implications of near ground/ceiling flight. Tradeoffs between safety and efficiency that are sensitive to the ground/ceiling models were discovered, highlighting the need for precise near-boundary models. The results of this study therefore offer guidance for near-boundary model-driven controllers that could improve situational awareness and sensorless landings.},

An indoor localization and positioning system is used to estimate the absolute 3D position of the swarm similar to GPS. A test scenario was built up to validate and optimize the swarm for the intended applications. Besides calibration of the IAQ sensors, we performed experiments to investigate the influence of the rotor downwash on the gas measurements at different altitudes and compared them with stationary measurements. Moreover, we did a first evaluation of the gas distribution mapping performance. Based on this novel IAQ monitoring concept, new algorithms in the field of Mobile Robot Olfaction (MRO) are planned to be developed exploiting the abilities of an aerial robotic swarm.},

abstract = {Inspired by the advantages from natural birds' shape-morphing adapted flight performance, this work investigates how the bioinspired adaptative morph induced inertia variation affects the flight performance of a morphing quad-rotor. Extensive numerical and experimental evaluations on a custom-built morphing quad-rotor that is steered along a predefined path and hovers in the presence of constant wind disturbance were performed and analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the smaller quad-rotor exhibits better agility performance due to the compact volume/size and lower weight, while the bigger one appears more flight robustness in a disturbed environment such as windy testing area. Experimental studies further prove that by adaptatively altering its volume/size, our quad-rotor with the bioinspired in-flight morphing behavior can well execute path following tasks in a constrained space without deviating the trajectory when encountering obstacles, as well it can withstand external wind torque through morphing up its volume to therewith increase relevant moment-of-inertia for improving the flight robustness. Compared to the regular scaled aerial vehicles whose volumes' change follows a weight change proportionally, our results also indicate that our in-flight morphing aerial vehicle mechanism (i.e. the quad-rotor morphs the volume but without changing weight/mass) shows more advantages in power efficiency and morphologically adaptative flight capability.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), in particular the four-rotor quadrotor, are gaining wide popularity in research as well as in commercial and hobbyist applications. Maneuvrability, low cost, and small size make quadrotors an attractive option to full-scale, manned helicopters while opening up new possibilities. These include applications where full-scale helicopters are unsuitable, such as cooperative tasks or operating indoors. Many UAV systems use the Global Positioning System (GPS), IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors, and camera sensors to observe the UAV's state. Depending on the application, different methods for observing the states are suitable. Outdoors, GPS is available and widely used and in cluttered environments on-board cameras can be the best choice. Controlled lab environments often use external cameras to track the quadrotor. Most applications make use of the IMU in their implementations, most commonly the gyroscope for attitude estimation. In this thesis, several external ultra-wideband (UWB) radio sensors are used to measure the distance between individual sensors and a quadrotor. The range measurements are fused with acceleration and angular velocity measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit to estimate the quadrotors position and attitude. An ultra-wideband sensor is cheap and does not require line-of-sight or heavy equipment mounted on the quadrotor. The drawback of UWB-based positioning is that it requires the assumption of known sensor locations in order to calculate the distance between sensor and UAV. This thesis aims to remove this assumption by estimating the quadrotor's and the sensors' position simultaneosly using the Smoothing and Mapping (SAM) technique. The Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping (GTSAM) framework provides the incremental Smoothing and Mapping implementation, used for estimation of both the quadrotor's position and attitude, and the sensors' position. The Inertial Measurement Unit is handled by the state of the art IMU factor, included in GTSAM. The system is evaluated with and without prior knowledge of the sensor positions, using recorded flight data from a Crazyflie quadrotor and six Loco Positioning Node sensors. The results show that the system is able to track the UAV's position and attitude with acceptable errors. The error in estimated sensor position is too large to be satisfactory, Based on the results several topics for future work are proposed.},

abstract = {Teleoperation tasks with multi-agent systems have a high potential in supporting human-swarm collaborative teams in exploration and rescue operations. However, it requires an intuitive and adaptive control approach to ensure swarm stability in a cluttered and dynamically shifting environment. We propose a novel human-swarm interaction system, allowing the user to control swarm position and formation by either direct hand motion or by trajectory drawing with a hand gesture interface based on the DNN gesture recognition. The key technology of the SwarmPaint is the user's ability to perform various tasks with the swarm without additional devices by switching between interaction modes. Two types of interaction were proposed and developed to adjust a swarm behavior: free-form trajectory generation control and shaped formation control. Two preliminary user studies were conducted to explore user's performance and subjective experience from human-swarm interaction through the developed control modes. The experimental results revealed a sufficient accuracy in the trajectory tracing task (mean error of 5.6 cm by gesture draw and 3.1 cm by mouse draw with the pattern of dimension 1 m by 1 m) over three evaluated trajectory patterns and up to 7.3 cm accuracy in targeting task with two target patterns of 1 m achieved by SwarmPaint interface. Moreover, the participants evaluated the trajectory drawing interface as more intuitive (12.9%) and requiring less effort to utilize (22.7%) than direct shape and position control by gestures, although its physical workload and failure in performance were presumed as more significant (by 9.1% and 16.3%, respectively). The proposed SwarmPaint technology can be potentially applied in various human-swarm scenarios, including complex environment exploration, dynamic lighting generation, and interactive drone shows, allowing users to actively participate in the swarm behavior decision on a different scale of control.},

To play with balls, certain physical methods, or "vocabularies," such as throwing, hitting, spinning, or kicking have been developed by reflecting the fact that balls obey physical dynamics. This feature forms the foundation of ball-based sports; however, we consider that it limits the possibility of such sports. For instance, the speed of balls could be considerably fast for small children, senior people, or people with physical disabilities. In this paper, we propose a flying ball based on quadcopter technology. This ball has the ability hover and to change its location and behavior based on the context of the sport or game. With this technology, the physical dynamics of a ball can be reprogrammed by sports designers, and new ball-playing vocabularies, such as hovering, anti-gravity, proximity, or remote manipulation, can be introduced to extend the method in which people interact with balls. In this paper, we introduce this concept as a method of augmenting sports, and present our initial flying ball system that consists of a grid shell that comprises a micro quadcopter, and demonstrates new sports interactions with the ball.},

abstract = {Here, agents learn how often to exchange information with neighbours in cooperative multi-agent systems (MASs) such that their linear quadratic regulator (LQR)-like performance indices are minimized. The investigated LQR-like cost functions capture trade-offs between the energy consumption of each agent and MAS local control performance in the presence of exogenous disturbances, delayed and noisy data. Agent energy consumption is critical for prolonging the MAS mission and is composed of both control (e.g. acceleration, velocity) and communication efforts. Taking provably stabilizing upper bounds on broadcasting intervals as optimization constraints, an online off-policy model-free learning algorithm based on least square policy iteration (LSPI) to minimize the cost function of each agent is employed. Consequently, the obtained broadcasting intervals adapt to the most recent information (e.g. delayed and noisy agents' inputs and/or outputs) received from neighbours whilst provably stabilize the MAS. Chebyshev polynomials are utilized as the approximator in the LSPI whereas Kalman filtering handles sampled, corrupted, and delayed data. Subsequently, convergence and near-optimality of our LSPI scheme are inspected. The proposed methodology is verified experimentally using an inexpensive motion capture system and nano quadrotors.},

However, there are situations where this localization infrastructure does not exist in the field, such as robotic exploration tasks. Deploying low power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as localization infrastructure can potentially solve this problem. In this work, we demonstrate the use of an OpenWSN network of miniaturized low power sensor nodes as localization infrastructure. We demonstrate a quadrotor performing laser-based relative bearing measurements of stationary wireless sensor nodes with known locations and using these measurements to localize itself. These laser-based measurements require little computation on the WSN nodes, and are compatible with state-of-the-art 2 mm × 3 mm monolithic wireless system-on-chips (SoCs). These capabilities were demonstrated on a Crazyflie quadcopter using an Extended Kalman Filter and a network of motes running the OpenWSN wireless sensor network stack. The RMS error for X positioning was 0.57 m and the error for Y positioning was 0.39 m. This is the first use of an OpenWSN sensor network to support robotic localization. Furthermore, simulations show that these same measurements could be used for localizing sensor motes with unknown locations in the future.},

We used computational fluid dynamics simulations of low-altitude and near-wall flights based on in vivo high-speed kinematic measurements to quantify changes in the self-generated pressure and velocity cues at the sensitive mechanosensory antennae. We validated the principle that encoding aerodynamic information can enable collision avoidance by developing a quadcopter with a sensory system inspired by the mosquito.

The observed significant altitude deviations due to airdraft interactions, mainly in the lower quadcopter, is adequately captured by our physics infused machine learning model. We use two strategies to mitigate these effects. First, we propose non-invasive, online and offline trajectory re-planning strategies that allow avoiding the interference zone while reducing the deviations from desired minimum snap trajectories. Second, we propose invasive strategies that re-design control algorithms by incorporating the interference model. We demonstrate how to modify the standard quadcopter PID controller, and how to formulate a model predictive control approach when considering the interference model. Both invasive and non-invasive strategies show significant reduction in tracking error and control signal energy as compared to the case where the interference area is ignored.},

abstract = {We propose a novel interaction strategy for a human-swarm communication when a human operator guides a formation of quadrotors with impedance control and receives vibrotactile feedback. The presented approach takes into account the human hand velocity and changes the formation shape and dynamics accordingly using impedance interlinks simulated between quadrotors, which helps to achieve a life-like swarm behavior. Experimental results with Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor platform validate the proposed control algorithm. The tactile patterns representing dynamics of the swarm (extension or contraction) are proposed. The user feels the state of the swarm at his fingertips and receives valuable information to improve the controllability of the complex life-like formation. The user study revealed the patterns with high recognition rates. Subjects stated that tactile sensation improves the ability to guide the drone formation and makes the human-swarm communication much more interactive. The proposed technology can potentially have a strong impact on the human-swarm interaction, providing a new level of intuitiveness and immersion into the swarm navigation.},

abstract = {This paper aims to design quadrotor swarm performances, where the swarm acts as an integrated, coordinated unit embodying moving and deforming objects. We divide the task of creating a choreography into three basic steps: designing swarm motion primitives, transitioning between those movements, and synchronizing the motion of the drones. The result is a flexible framework for designing choreographies comprised of a wide variety of motions. The motion primitives can be intuitively designed using a few parameters, providing a rich library for choreography design. Moreover, we combine and adapt existing goal assignment and trajectory generation algorithms to maximize the smoothness of the transitions between motion primitives. Finally, we propose a correction algorithm to compensate for motion delays and synchronize the motion of the drones to a desired periodic motion pattern. The proposed methodology was validated experimentally by generating and executing choreographies on a swarm of 25 quadrotors.},

abstract = {Mixed Reality can be a valuable tool for research and development in robotics. In this work, we refine the definition of Mixed Reality to accommodate seamless interaction between physical and virtual objects in any number of physical or virtual environments. In particular, we show that Mixed Reality can reduce the gap between simulation and implementation by enabling the prototyping of algorithms on a combination of physical and virtual objects, including robots, sensors, and humans. Robots can be enhanced with additional virtual capabilities, or can interact with humans without sharing physical space. We demonstrate Mixed Reality with three representative experiments, each of which highlights the advantages of our approach. We also provide a testbed for Mixed Reality with three different virtual robotics environments in combination with the Crazyflie 2.0 quadcopter.},

@article{Anderson2020,
abstract = {Biohybrid systems integrate living materials with synthetic devices, exploiting their respective advantages to solve challenging engineering problems. One challenge of critical importance to society is detecting and localizing airborne volatile chemicals. Many flying animals depend their ability to detect and locate the source of aerial chemical plumes for finding mates and food sources. A robot with comparable capability could reduce human hazard and drastically improve performance on tasks such as locating disaster survivors, hazardous gas leaks, incipient fires, or explosives. Three advances are needed before they can rival their biological counterparts: (1) a chemical sensor with a much faster response time that nevertheless satisfies the size, weight, and power constraints of flight, (2) a design, sensor suite, and control system that allows it to move toward the source of a plume fully autonomously while navigating obstacles, and (3) the ability to detect the plume with high specificity and sensitivity among the assortment of chemicals that invariably exist in the air. Here we address the first two, introducing a human-safe palm-sized air vehicle equipped with the odor-sensing antenna of an insect, the first odor-sensing biohybrid robot system to fly. Using this sensor along with a suite of additional navigational sensors, as well as passive wind fins, our robot orients upwind and navigates autonomously toward the source of airborne plumes. Our robot is the first flying biohybrid system to successfully perform odor localization in a confined space, and it is able to do so while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its flight path. We show that insect antennae respond more quickly than metal oxide gas sensors, enabling odor localization at an improved speed over previous flying robots. By using the insect antennae, we anticipate a feasible path toward improved chemical specificity and sensitivity by leveraging recent advances in gene editing.},

@article{Cardona2021,
abstract = {Transporting objects using quadrotors with cables has been widely studied in the literature. However, most of those approaches assume that the cables are previously attached to the load by human intervention. In tasks where multiple objects need to be moved, the efficiency of the robotic system is constrained by the requirement of manual labor. Our approach uses a non-stretchable cable connected to two quadrotors, which we call the catenary robot, that fully automates the transportation task. Using the cable, we can roll and drag the cuboid object (box) on planar surfaces. Depending on the surface type, we choose the proper action, dragging for low friction, and rolling for high friction. Therefore, the transportation process does not require any human intervention as we use the cable to interact with the box without requiring fastening. We validate our control design in simulation and with actual robots, where we show them rolling and dragging boxes to track desired trajectories.},

@article{Burgues2019,
abstract = {This paper describes the development and validation of the currently smallest aerial platform with olfaction capabilities. The developed Smelling Nano Aerial Vehicle (SNAV) is based on a lightweight commercial nano-quadcopter (27 g) equipped with a custom gas sensing board that can host up to two in situ metal oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensors. Due to its small form-factor, the SNAV is not a hazard for humans, enabling its use in public areas or inside buildings. It can autonomously carry out gas sensing missions of hazardous environments inaccessible to terrestrial robots and bigger drones, for example searching for victims and hazardous gas leaks inside pockets that form within the wreckage of collapsed buildings in the aftermath of an earthquake or explosion. The first contribution of this work is assessing the impact of the nano-propellers on the MOX sensor signals at different distances to a gas source. A second contribution is adapting the ‘bout' detection algorithm, proposed by Schmuker et al. (2016) to extract specific features from the derivative of the MOX sensor response, for real-time operation. The third and main contribution is the experimental validation of the SNAV for gas source localization (GSL) and mapping in a large indoor environment (160 m 2 ) with a gas source placed in challenging positions for the drone, for example hidden in the ceiling of the room or inside a power outlet box. Two GSL strategies are compared, one based on the instantaneous gas sensor response and the other one based on the bout frequency. From the measurements collected (in motion) along a predefined sweeping path we built (in less than 3 min) a 3D map of the gas distribution and identified the most likely source location. Using the bout frequency yielded on average a higher localization accuracy than using the instantaneous gas sensor response (1.38 m versus 2.05 m error), however accurate tuning of an additional parameter (the noise threshold) is required in the former case. The main conclusion of this paper is that a nano-drone has the potential to perform gas sensing tasks in complex environments.},
